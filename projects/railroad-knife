# 🗡️ Railroad Spike Knife

**Overview:**  
Custom knife developed from a railroad spike, showcasing forging, heat treatment, and hands-on metalworking skills.

**Materials & Tools:**  
- Railroad spike steel (~0.4% carbon content)  
- High-temperature furnace (~900°C)  
- Sledgehammer and clamps  
- Quenching oil  
- Hand tools for shaping and twisting  

**Process:**  
1. **Forging the Blade:** Heated steel in the furnace and hammered into shape (~4 hours).  
2. **Shaping the Handle:** Clamped, heated, and twisted the upper section to finish the handle.  
3. **Heat Treatment:**  
   - **Quenching:** Heated and quenched in oil to increase toughness.  
   - **Tempering:** Heated to ~400°C and cooled naturally to reduce brittleness.

**Skills Applied:**  
- Metallurgy & material properties  
- Forging & manual metalworking  
- Quenching & tempering  
- Precision shaping and finishing

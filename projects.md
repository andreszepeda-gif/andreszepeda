# Railroad Spike Knife Project

## Overview
This project showcases a custom knife developed from a railroad spike. It highlights hands-on metalworking, forging, and heat treatment techniques to produce a functional and durable knife.

## Materials and Tools
- Railroad spike steel (~0.4% carbon content)  
- High-temperature furnace (~900°C)  
- Sledgehammer and clamps  
- Quenching oil  
- Hand tools for shaping and twisting  

## Process
1. **Forging the Blade**  
   - Heated the steel in the furnace to ~900°C.  
   - Used a sledgehammer to forge the steel into the shape of a knife over ~4 hours.  

2. **Shaping the Handle**  
   - Clamped the blade and heated the upper section.  
   - Twisted the heated section to create the handle finish.  

3. **Heat Treatment**  
   - **Quenching:** Heated the blade and quenched in oil to increase toughness.  
   - **Tempering:** Heated at ~400°C and allowed to cool naturally to reduce brittleness and improve malleability.  

## Skills Applied
- Metallurgy (understanding steel properties and heat treatment)  
- Forging and manual metalworking  
- Quenching and tempering techniques  
- Precision shaping and finishing
